3,3,0,0,3,2,"I think you’re giving Warner too much credit. All that stuff you said about Warner wanting compatibility wasn’t about Elle’s true personality it was him making assumptions about her. Early in the movie we see how dedicated she is to something when she puts her mind to it and she has the best grades in her sorority. She even started studying for the LSATS pretty last minute compared to most law students and still did really well.   Now Warner didn’t know about her studying for Harvard, but he still assumed that she wasn’t smart enough even though she balances great grades and being president of her sorority chapter all because she is blonde and peppy.  Then she gets into Harvard and he still assumes the least of her. He flat out tells her that she will never have a chance at an internship even though she had the stellar test scores, grades, and extracurriculars to not only go to law school but a very prestigious one. This proves that he had a shallow view of Elle and never really understood her. If he cared so much about being with someone who is smart then he still wouldn’t be dismissive of her talents."
4,3,1,1,1,2,"“You’re never gonna get the grades to qualify for that internship, you’re not smart enough for that, sweetie.”  That was the line that turned him from normal ex-boyfriend into villain. He literally called her stupid, despite them getting into the exact same law school and taking the exact same classes, which Elle points out in the next line. That’s where he’s solidified as the villain. She’s been floundering a little bit through the start of law school, but that’s due to a lack of preparedness and the plan to drop out as soon as she gets him back, not due to any lack of intelligence on her end."

6,3,0,0,3,2,"> *Legally Blonde* is told entirely through Elle Woods’ perspective.  But it's not. Elle isn't narrating, the narrative isn't using her words or expressing her thoughts and motivations through the storytelling. There is no narrator, only the narrative. Which is showing Elle's story, but not through her eyes. The narrative itself presents Warner as a not very good person. Not a villain, no, but also not a good person. He's an average spoiled rich kid that hasn't matured and is inconsiderate and self-centered. A typical college aged jerk who uses people and makes callous decisions regarding people's feelings.  And that's okay. He can be a not very good guy and still a good character. Which is something to keep in mind - he is a character, written with a specific role in the story to play. I feel like a lot of this very much ignores his specific role in the story."
7,3,0,0,3,2,"I dunno in the ""he didn't lead her on"" part. There is no way that Elle didn't make it extremely clear that she was in it for the end game of marriage. His comment on needing a Jackie and not a Marilyn sounded to me like he was saying Elle was fine for having fun with but not for marrying. The film was made during the Clinton presidency and we're getting the idea that Warren was looking for more of a power couple like Bill/Hillary. But he also had to have known this earlier.    Part of the film is that Elle wasn't taken seriously at the beginning because she was focusing on entirely feminine things as she assumed was expected of her. Realistically she was going to do fine as an old-fashioned politician's wife and was preparing accordingly for that role. She was blonde, attractive, had a non-threatening degree, her role in the sorority was event planning. She doesn't actually want Warren himself back, she wants to be taken seriously and get back the future she had been working for. On the way she gains more respect for herself and gains a new ambition for herself. But she was already serious and ambitious in her own way. She just learns to combine her girlishness with her new ""serious"" goals. The audience and everyone else doesn't take her seriously or respect her in the beginning because it's commenting on the way we don't always respect more feminine interests.    I think Warren is subdued because he's embarrassed that his college fling is smarter than he is and showing him up after he wildly underestimated her.    I'm going to have to re-watch the film..."
8,3,0,0,3,2,"He broke up with her because he thought she was dumb and frivolous.   He was ENGAGED before September of the year he broke up with her (in April/May).   I'm sorry - that is villain behaviour because you cannot convince me that Selma Blaire's character is the kind of impulsive woman who would accept an engagement ring, no matter how large, from a man she had only been seeing for AT MAX 5 months. Naw, he has been seeing her every summer since high school. They were fated to be by their country club parents before either of them even had their first private school trauma story."
9,3,0,0,3,2,"There is a difference between something being a retelling from somebody's perspective and it being shown from their POV.  Elle doesn’t narrate the movie or ever give us any indication that what’s happening is filtered through her perspective. We ride with her and only see what she does, but we’re seeing an accurate version of what happens around her. All that’s missing are events she’s not present for.   That said, he is actually quite reasonable during the breakup. He needs to be for us to root for her getting him back initially. It’s what happens after she gets to Harvard that makes him the bad guy.  "

11,3,0,2,1,1,What was that kinky hookup group? My engagement just ended and I need some tits to play with lol
12,3,0,2,1,1,"Unironically the same thing rescued me from becoming an incel. Was turning into kind of a proto-incel in highschool, and had driven away most of my female friends. Started hanging with the only girl that still tolerated me, and she wasn't looking for a boyfriend but liked getting her nipples sucked on while she touched herself. She was happy to let me do the sucking, but only if I behaved and didn't act like a bitter neckbeard.     Anytime I texted her angry bullshit she'd just straight ghost me for a week or so. Quickly decided I liked titties more than venting. That friendship didn't really survive highschool but more than a decade later I pretty much single-handedly credit her boobs for setting me down a better life path."
